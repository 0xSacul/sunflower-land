# Welcome to Sunflower Land docs contributing guide

Thank you for joining our journey and helping us build the #1 Community Metaverse game

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow for getting your artwork in the game

### Disclaimer

By contributing to this repository you provide Sunflower Land the rights to use your work in the game indefintely. While we often reward open source developers with NFTs, contributing does not guarantee any sort of rewards from the game.

You confirm that the artwork is original and completely your design. Copying others artwork can land yourself and the project in trouble.

## How can I help?

If you have a bright idea, open an issue or join our active Discord #artists-chat first and start a discussion. We love to bring in the community ideas where possible!

Don't have any ideas? We would suggest scanning the open issues and seeing if there is something that catches your eye.

If you are looking for something to work on, the team manages an open list of art requests on Github you can check out - https://github.com/sunflower-land/sunflower-land/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22art+request%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc

## Artwork specs

Sunflower Land is based on an asset pack - https://danieldiggle.itch.io/sunnyside

To submit art, you will want to use the same color palette, proportions and pixellated effect of the current artwork.

_Dimensions_

The artwork is heavily pixellated which gives it a light and friendly appearance.

We recommend that most artwork falls within the 20x30 pixels. If you are designing a smaller item (like an icon, meal or pot plant), aim for 10x10.

When submitting your artwork, ensure that a square pixel is actually 1x1. This helps keep the raw assets small and makes the game load faster for players.

_Style_

Artwork is always quite subjective. Once you are happy with your art, overlay it on the map using the preview URL below.

Here is an example of the statue - Make sure you include other surrounding elements to ensure that it matches with them

_Colour palette is coming soon..._

## How do I submit the art work?

To help organize what art work the project needs, what is being voted on and what is accepted please upload your image as an attachment to the Github issue.

You will need to include:

- The raw asset - minified version (1px units) and an enlarged preview version
- A screenshot of the asset in the game
- Your Polygon address (often used for airdropping assets to the winning designer)

## How does the art get accepted?

The team is exploring DAO mechanisms and voting rights for people with certain NFTs. Until we have this automated system, artwork is picked by community consensus in Discord and on the Github issue.
